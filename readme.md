A script for [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

It hides (highlights in red border for now :P) 
already seen videos in "related" on YouTube.

To do
--

* apply hiding from other tabs/windows without page refresh
* hiding on [subscriptions page](https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions)
* warning about full storage
* real hiding instead of just highlighting already seen videos with red border
* handle dynamically loaded videos
* stop including playlist (&list=blabla) as hidables

How it was made?
