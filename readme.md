DadaTube
===

A script for [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

It hides (highlights in red border for now :P) 
already seen videos on YouTube.

To do
--

* warning about full storage
* real hiding instead of just highlighting already seen videos with red border
* handle dynamically loaded videos

How it was made?
