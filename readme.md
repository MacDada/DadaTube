DadaTube
===

A script for [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

It hides (highlights in red border for now :P) already seen videos in "related" on YouTube.

To do
--

* hiding on [subscriptions page](https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions)
* handling "first" videos in related
* hiding on [homepage](https://www.youtube.com/)
* warning about full storage
* real hiding instead of just highlighting already seen videos with red border

How it was made?
